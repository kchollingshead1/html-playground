    <h2 align="center">Oaktown Rings</h2>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Pure metals. Liquefied. Molded. Hammered. Filed. I make each ring by hand at my shop in Oakland, CA.</p>
    <p>When I receive your order, I begin by melting down pure sterling silver or titanium in our foundry. I then pour
        the metal into a mold that I make from a special type of clay (the molds are made and re-made for each
        customer). Then I begin the refining process: hammering and filing the ring into it's final shape. After sanding
        and brushing it down to a comfortable finish, I like to leave the ring with evidences that it's been worked on
        AND that it will be worked in.</p>
    <p>When I was getting married I realized all I wanted was a light, comfortable ring that I could wear to work and
        work in the yard. But I couldn't find anything that fit my style. So I went to my shop, melted some pure
        sterling silver in my forge and I made my own. I had a lot of fun and I wanted to offer exactly what I wear: a
        hand poured, hammered ring that is made of solid sterling silver, filed down to size and sanded to a matte
        finish. No ring will look the same. It would be impossible.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or requests (think: thinner/thicker band (3mm, 4mm, 5mm or 6mm and any size, etc), just
        leave a comment in the conversation tab and I'll make it for you.</p>
